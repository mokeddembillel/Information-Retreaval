# Information-Retreaval

  A small project on Information Retreaval which consist of indexing a collection of documents and Implementing a boolean and a vector model to retreave the documents that most conform with a given query. 

  For testing purposes we implemented four measures for the vector model (Inner Product, Dice Coefficient, Cosine and Jaccard).
